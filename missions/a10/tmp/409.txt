03 23 20 33 LMP And, Houston, this is Snoopy. The ascent batteries look good. The backup and normal feed is good. And my ED voltage is 37 on A and 37 on B. 

03 23 20 45 CC Roger. We copy. 37 on ED's.

03 23 21 10 CDR Charlie Brown, Snoopy. Our next step here - We got to have the hatch closed, so I'll stand by to help you with the probe and drogue when you're ready, babe.

03 23 21 19 CMP Roger.

03 23 24 46 LMP Houston, this is Snoopy. How about giving me the next LOS end the next AOS time, please?

03 23 24 52 CC Okay, Snoopy. Your next LOS will be at 95 40, and your next AOS will be at 96 27. And I have some LM GYRO torque angles for you. 

03 23 25 14 LMP Stand by half a second.

03 23 25 45 LMP Okay. Go ahead with your LM GYRO torque angles.

03 23 25 48 CC Okay. LM GYRO torque: X, minus 00730; Y minus 00700; Z, plus 00570.

03 23 26 08 LMP Okay. I got X, minus 00730; Y, minus 00700; and Z is plus 00570. Is that correct? 

03 23 26 18 CC That's affirmative. You've got them right. There's one more thing we can try an our VHF situation. We may have the corona built up on our VHF A transmitter, so VHF A transmitter switch OFF for several seconds and then back to VOICE. Over.

03 23 26 38 LMP I don't think that will work, Jack. When we just tried it again, it had been in the OFF position. I put it to VOICE. We'll give it a try here in minute, though.

03 23 26 45 CC Roger.

03 23 26 52 LMP I was suiting up while this COMM problem started. Is it a VHF A Simplex mode?

03 23 26 58 CC That's affirmative. Unable to transmit Snoopy to Charlie Broun on VHF A. 

03 23 27 08 LMP Okay. That sort of blows the ranging capability, doesn't it.
