03 22 56 11 CDR Okay, Jose. How are you doing? I'm ready to do that docked alignment - the docked alignment if you are. How are you doing there? 

03 22 56 25 CMP Okay. I'm about ready.

03 22 56 31 CDR Okay, John. When you get all squared away, we go in the minimum deadband attitude hold, hold the rascal tight; and then on your mark, if you can give me VERB 06 NOUN 20, and then just hold it until I get my alignment squared away. 

03 22 56 52 CMP Okay. I'm going to SCS and then deadband.

03 22 57 04 CMP Okay. We're in MIN deadband.

03 22 57 07 CDR Okay. If you're in MIN deadband attitude hold and when it all settles down there, give me VERB 06 NOUN 20, and we'll bare at it. Over. 

03 22 57 16 CMP Roger. VERB 06 NOUN 20: it's 13807 20094 00055.
